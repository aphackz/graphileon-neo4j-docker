# graphileon-neo4j-docker
Builds docker image containing graphileon and neo4j
To use this project, you need to download the neo4j-community-3.2.6-unix.tar.gz file from the neo4j website
and place it in the root directory.  The version currently on the distribution site seems to be corrupted and
won't download properly with curl.
